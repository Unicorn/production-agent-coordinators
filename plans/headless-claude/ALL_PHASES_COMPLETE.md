- Custom subagents (`code-reviewer`, `test-writer`)
- Custom commands (`scaffold-package`, `fix-compliance`)
- Extended thinking integration (`think`, `think hard`, `ultrathink`)

---

## ✅ Phase 3: Parallelization

**Status:** Complete  
**Tests:** 7/7 passing

### Implemented
- Git worktree support (`createWorktree`, `mergeWorktrees`, `cleanupWorktrees`)
- Parallel build workflow (`ParallelBuildWorkflow`)
- True parallelism with isolated worktrees
- Merge coordination and conflict handling

### Key Benefits
- Significant speedup for large packages
- Complete context isolation
- Independent failure handling
- Scales to arbitrary number of tasks

---

## ✅ Phase 4: Integration

**Status:** Complete  
**Tests:** 9/9 passing (integration), 14/14 passing (unit)

### Implemented
- Git/PR automation (commit, push, create PR)
- Hooks integration (tool call and response logging)
- Optimization dashboard (analyze audit traces)
- Credential checks (early failure detection)
- End-to-end integration tests

### Key Features
- Provider-agnostic Git operations
- Real-time audit logging via hooks
- Comprehensive optimization analysis
- Early credential validation

---

## ✅ Phase 5: Optimization

**Status:** Complete  
**Tests:** 6/6 passing

### Implemented
- A/B testing framework for model selection
- Thinking level tuning utilities
- Subagent optimization analysis
- CLI tool (`optimization-runner`)

### Key Features
- Systematic comparison of configurations
- Statistical analysis of results
- Automatic optimal configuration selection
- Actionable recommendations

---

## Test Coverage Summary

| Phase | Test File | Tests | Status |
|-------|-----------|-------|--------|
| Phase 3 | `worktree-activities.test.ts` | 7 | ✅ Passing |
| Phase 4 | `phase4-integration.test.ts` | 14 | ✅ Passing |
| Phase 4 | `integration/phase4-e2e.test.ts` | 9 | ✅ Passing |
| Phase 5 | `optimization-activities.test.ts` | 6 | ✅ Passing |
| **Total** | | **36** | **✅ All Passing** |

- Thinking level tuning for optimal budget allocation
- A/B testing framework for data-driven decisions

### 3. Comprehensive Integration
- Git operations (commit, push, PR creation)
- Real-time audit logging via hooks
- Optimization dashboard for analysis
- Early credential validation

### 4. Production Ready
- All tests passing
- Comprehensive documentation
- Error handling and cleanup
- Provider-agnostic design

## Usage Examples

### Basic Workflow
```typescript
const result = await ClaudeAuditedBuildWorkflow({
  specFileContent: '...',
  requirementsFileContent: '...',
  createPR: true,
});
```

### Parallel Workflow
```typescript
const result = await ParallelBuildWorkflow({
  specFileContent: '...',
  requirementsFileContent: '...',
  tasks: [
    { name: 'types', branchName: 'feature/types', instruction: '...' },
    { name: 'core', branchName: 'feature/core', instruction: '...' },
  ],
});
```

### Optimization
```bash
# A/B test model selection
npm run optimization-runner ab-test architecture-comparison

# Tune thinking levels
npm run optimization-runner thinking architecture-thinking

# Optimize subagent strategies
npm run optimization-runner subagent parallel-vs-sequential
```
