# User Guide

Complete guide to using the Workflow Builder system.

## Getting Started

- **[Projects](projects.md)** - Creating and managing projects
- **[Components](components.md)** - Understanding and creating components
- **[Agent Prompts](agent-prompts.md)** - Creating AI agent prompts (manual and AI-assisted)
- **[Agent Testing](agent-testing.md)** - Testing agent prompts interactively
- **[Building Workflows](building-workflows.md)** - Visual workflow editor
- **[Deploying Workflows](deploying-workflows.md)** - Compiling and deploying
- **[Executing Workflows](executing-workflows.md)** - Running workflows
- **[Advanced Workflows](advanced-workflows.md)** - Advanced patterns

## Quick Start

1. **Create a Project** - Organize your workflows
2. **Create Components** - Build reusable building blocks
3. **Build a Workflow** - Compose workflows visually
4. **Deploy** - Make workflows available for execution
5. **Execute** - Run workflows and monitor results

## Core Concepts

### Projects
Projects group related workflows and provide isolation. Each project has its own task queue and worker.

### Components
Reusable building blocks for workflows. Components can be activities, agents, signals, or triggers.

### Workflows
Visual compositions of components that execute via Temporal. Workflows define the flow of work.
