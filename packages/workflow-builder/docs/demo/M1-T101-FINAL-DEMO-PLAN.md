## Contingency Plans and Backup Strategies

### Level 1: Minor Issue (Single Feature Fails)

**Scenario**: One specific feature doesn't work (e.g., deployment hangs)

**Response**:
1. **Stay calm** - don't panic or apologize excessively
2. **Acknowledge briefly**: "This particular feature seems to be having an issue"
3. **Pivot smoothly**: "Let me show you our pre-built example instead"
4. **Use backup**: Navigate to already-deployed workflow
5. **Continue demo**: Show remaining features
6. **Note for follow-up**: Make mental note to include in follow-up email

**Backup Materials**:
- Pre-deployed workflows in demo environment
- Already-configured activities
- Pre-executed workflow results

**Practice Script**:
> "It looks like deployment is taking longer than expected. While that processes in the background, let me show you this workflow that's already deployed and ready to execute."

---

### Level 2: Major Issue (Multiple Features Fail)

**Scenario**: Multiple critical features fail, demo environment unstable

**Response**:
1. **Assess quickly** (30 seconds max)
2. **Make decisive call**: Switch to backup recording
3. **Professional transition**: Use prepared script
4. **Play recording**: Full screen, narrate along
5. **Continue Q&A**: Maintain engagement
6. **Offer hands-on later**: "Full environment access after this call"

**Backup Materials**:
- Screen recording of successful demo run
- Recording location: `/docs/demo/milestone-1-recording.mp4`
- Alternative: Backup environment URL (if deployed)

**Practice Script**:
> "We're experiencing some technical difficulties with the live environment. Rather than troubleshoot on the spot, let me show you the recording we made this morning of a complete successful run. This shows the exact flow you would have seen. [Play recording and narrate]. We'll make sure everyone has access to the hands-on environment after this call."

---

### Level 3: Complete Failure (Everything Fails)

**Scenario**: Demo environment down, backup recording unavailable, total technical failure

**Response**:
1. **Stay professional and honest**
2. **Pivot to slides**: Use screenshot-based presentation
3. **Focus on achievements**: Talk through success metrics
4. **Deep Q&A session**: Turn demo time into discussion
5. **Schedule do-over**: Offer rescheduled hands-on demo
6. **Maintain confidence**: This doesn't reflect on the quality of the work

**Backup Materials**:
- Presentation slides with screenshots
- Success metrics document (printed or on screen)
- Architecture diagrams
- Talking points for extended discussion

**Practice Script**:
> "We're experiencing a major technical issue that's preventing the live demo. These things happen in software. Rather than waste your time troubleshooting, let me walk you through what we've built using these slides and have a deeper conversation about the architecture, roadmap, and your questions. We'll schedule a hands-on session for next week where you can see it working and try it yourselves."

**Follow-Up Actions**:
- Schedule dedicated hands-on demo within 3 business days
- Root cause analysis of what failed
- Distribute screen recording via email same day
- Personal apology and reassurance from engineering lead

---

### Recovery Decision Matrix

| Scenario | Response | Decision Time | Success Metric |
|----------|----------|---------------|----------------|
| Single feature fails | Use pre-built example | 30 seconds | Demo continues smoothly |
| Deployment hangs | Switch to deployed workflow | 30 seconds | Show execution instead |
| Execution fails | Use different workflow | 30 seconds | Successful completion shown |
| Multiple failures | Switch to recording | 1 minute | Stakeholders see full capabilities |
| Complete failure | Use slides + discussion | 2 minutes | Maintain stakeholder confidence |

**Decision Authority**: Primary Presenter makes the call, DevOps Engineer advises

## Risk Assessment and Mitigation

### High-Risk Scenarios

#### Risk 1: Key Team Member Unavailable Day-of
**Probability**: Low (10%)
**Impact**: Medium
**Mitigation**:
- All team members cross-trained on primary presenter role
- Backup presenter assigned and prepared
- Demo script detailed enough for anyone to present
- Support roles can be redistributed on-the-fly

---

#### Risk 2: Demo Environment Fails During Presentation
**Probability**: Low (15%)
**Impact**: High
**Mitigation**:
- Comprehensive pre-demo testing (1 hour before)
- Backup recording ready to play
- Backup environment URL available
- Slides with screenshots as tertiary backup
- Professional recovery scripts prepared

---

#### Risk 3: Low Stakeholder Attendance
**Probability**: Medium (30%)
**Impact**: Medium
**Mitigation**:
- Send invites 3 days ahead with calendar holds
- Reminder email 1 day before
- Executive sponsor sends personalized invites
- Record demo for those who can't attend
- Reschedule if critical stakeholders can't make it

---

#### Risk 4: Difficult Questions We Can't Answer
**Probability**: Medium (40%)
**Impact**: Low
**Mitigation**:
- Comprehensive talking points prepared (20+ questions)
- Practice difficult Q&A scenarios in rehearsal
- Honest "I'll research and follow up" is acceptable
- Support team helps with technical deep-dives
- Document all questions for follow-up

---

#### Risk 5: Timeline Runs Long (>20 minutes)
**Probability**: Medium (25%)
**Impact**: Low
**Mitigation**:
- Strict timing in demo script with checkpoints
- Practice transitions to save time
- Be ready to skip Part 6 (example workflows) if needed
- Politely defer detailed questions to follow-up
- Time keeper in support team monitoring

---

#### Risk 6: Technical Questions Beyond Our Depth
**Probability**: Low (20%)
**Impact**: Low
**Mitigation**:
- Backend and DevOps engineers on support team
- Architecture documentation readily available
- "That's a great deep-dive question - let's follow up with diagrams"
- Offer dedicated technical deep-dive session
- Temporal documentation links ready to share

---

### Monitoring During Demo

**DevOps Engineer Checklist** (monitor quietly in background):
- [ ] Browser console (any red errors?)
- [ ] Network tab (any failed requests?)
- [ ] Temporal UI (workflow execution status)
- [ ] Docker logs (any service crashes?)
- [ ] System resources (CPU/memory normal?)

**If issues detected**:
1. Assess severity (does it block demo?)
2. Attempt quick fix if non-blocking
3. Notify primary presenter via Slack if blocking
4. Recommend backup plan if unfixable in <2 min

- Team celebration: [Date/Time]

**Remember**:
- We've practiced this 5 times successfully

**Your Role Matters**:
Whether you're presenting, supporting, or monitoring - every role is critical to our success. Trust your preparation. Trust each other. Trust the work we've done.

**If Things Go Wrong**:
We have multiple fallback plans. Stay calm, follow the procedures, and remember: even if the demo stumbles, the quality of our work doesn't change. We've built something excellent.

**After the Demo**:
Regardless of outcome, we'll retrospect, learn, and improve for M2. But I'm confident we're going to nail this.

Let's show them what we built! 🚀

See you at rehearsal,
