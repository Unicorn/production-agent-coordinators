## Presentation Tips

### Visual Design
- **Consistency**: Use same font sizes, colors, layout throughout
- **White Space**: Don't overcrowd slides - less is more
- **Contrast**: Ensure text is readable (dark on light or vice versa)
- **Icons**: Use consistent icon style (flat, outlined, etc.)
- **Screenshots**: Ensure high quality, crop appropriately, add borders if needed

### Content Guidelines
- **One Idea Per Slide**: Each slide should have a single clear message
- **Bullet Points**: Keep to 5-7 points max per slide
- **Numbers**: Use large, bold numbers for key metrics
- **Hierarchy**: Most important info at top or largest
- **Call-Outs**: Highlight key achievements with colors or boxes

### Presentation Flow
- **Opening**: Strong start with title and agenda
- **Problem**: Frame the challenge clearly
- **Solution**: Position our work as transformational
- **Evidence**: Show metrics and screenshots
- **Next Steps**: Clear call to action

### If Using Slides as Backup
- **Narration**: Each slide should have 1-2 minutes of talking points
- **Engagement**: Pause for questions after key slides
- **Flexibility**: Be ready to skip or reorder based on questions
- **Visuals**: Let screenshots tell the story
- **Enthusiasm**: Maintain energy even without live demo
