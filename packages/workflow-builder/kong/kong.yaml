# Kong Declarative Configuration
# Main configuration file for workflow-builder Kong API Gateway
#
# This file can be used with `kong config db_import kong.yaml`
# or referenced by individual YAML files in subdirectories.
#
# For development, Kong is typically configured dynamically via the Admin API
# using the KongClient in src/lib/kong/client.ts. This declarative config
# serves as documentation and can be used for production deployments.

# Note: Kong doesn't natively support imports, but this structure
# documents the expected configuration. Use kong-setup.sh to apply.
